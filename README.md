# DrumKit
The Drum Kit Project is a simple web application allowing users to play virtual drums either by pressing keys on their keyboard or clicking on the drum buttons on the screen. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To use it, clone the repository, open the index.html file in your web browser, and start playing.
